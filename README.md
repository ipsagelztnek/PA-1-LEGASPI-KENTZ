Python Practice Problems

This repository contains three short Python exercises I worked on for practice. Each problem focuses on a simple but important Python concept: sorting strings, replacing words with emoticons, and unpacking list elements.  
The goal of this project is to practice basic Python programming. By solving small exercises, I get to apply simple concepts in a way that builds a stronger foundation for bigger coding tasks later on.  

1.  Alphabet Soup Problem
This function takes a word and rearranges its letters in alphabetical order.  
Itâ€™s a simple way to practice string manipulation.

2. This one replaces certain words in a sentence with their corresponding emoticons.

3. This function unpacks a list into three parts:
 the first element
 everything in the middle
 the last element
